CHILD CARE: TOWARD WHAT KIND OF ``SOCIAL EUROPE''?,MAHON R,2002,"CHILD CARE IS CENTRAL TO CONTEMPORARY WELFARE STATE REDESIGN. THE EMERGENCE OF THE DUAL-EARNER FAMILY CHALLENGES STATES TO TAKE ON NEW RESPONSIBILITIES AS FAMILIES CAN NO LONGER PROVIDE FULL-TIME CARE, NOR CAN THE), AFFORD TO RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON MARKETS. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, DIFFERENT WAYS OF ADDRESSING THE CARE DEFICIT, AND EACH HOLDS DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUALITY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE THREE DOMINANT ALTERNATIVES BEING PURSUED IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, ARGUING THAT EACH ESTABLISHES A DIFFERENT ``HORIZON OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS.'' WELFARE STATE REDESIGN NO LONGER TAKES PLACE EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN NATIONAL BOUNDARIES, HOWEVER. THE STRUGGLE TO BUILD AS SOCIAL EUROPE'' IS ENGAGING MEMBER STATES IN REFLEXIVE PRACTICES, OPENING THEM TO NEW AND DIFFERENT IDEAS. THE ARTICLE THUS CONCLUDES BY EXAMINING WHICH, IF ANY, OF THE COMPETING MODELS OF CARE PROVISION HAS COME TO DEFINE ``BEST PRACTICE'' FOR EUROPE AND WHAT THIS TELLS US ABOUT THE EMERGENT CONTOURS OF SOCIAL EUROPE.",SOCIAL POLITICS,unambiguous,1
"RECOGNIZING GENDER, REDISTRIBUTING LABOR",OLSON K,2002,"MANY FEMINISTS HAVE THEORIZED WELFARE REGIMES DESIGNED TO DEGENDER LABOR AND ENCOURAGE MEN TO SHARE CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. I CLAIM THAT SUCH POLICIES ARE PROBLEMATIC TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE JOINT EFFECTS OF CHOICE AND ENCULTURATION IN PEOPLE'S USE OF WELFARE BENEFITS. IN A PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY AND A DEMOCRATIC STATE, PEOPLE'S CHOICES WILL REFLECT AND REPRODUCE THE GENDER NORMS OF THEIR OWN SOCIALIZATION. TO FOIL THIS PARADOX, I CLAIM THAT FEMINIST WELFARE REGIMES MUST PROMOTE EQUAL CULTURAL AGENCY AS A COMPONENT OF UNIVERSAL CITIZENSHIP, CULTURAL AGENCY IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS WHAT AMARTYA SEN CALLS A ``CAPABILITY.''",SOCIAL POLITICS,unambiguous,1
"SOCIAL CARE IN CRISIS: GENDER, DEMOGRAPHY, AND WELFARE STATE RESTRUCTURING IN JAPAN",PENG I,2002,"THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT WELFARE STATE RESTRUCTURING IN JAPAN IN THE 1990S FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHANGES IN GENDER RELATIONS AND DEMOGRAPHY. CONTRARY TO THE RETRENCHMENT PRESSURES EXERTED BY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL GLOBALIZATION THAT FIGURED PREDOMINANTLY IN THE 1980S, CHANGES IN GENDER RELATIONS AND DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS HAVE BEEN STIMULATING THE JAPANESE WELFARE STATE IN AN EXPANSIONARY DIRECTION, AS WITNESSED BY MORE ACTIVE ROLES TAKEN BY THE STATE IN PROVIDING SOCIAL CARE AND PROMOTING FAMILY-WORK RECONCILIATION. WELFARE STATE RESTRUCTURING IN JAPAN IN THE 1990S IS INTERESTING NOT ONLY, BECAUSE OF ITS JUNCTURE WITH A BROADER REGIME SHIFT CHARACTERIZED BY THE COLLAPSE OF THE OLD-STYLE CONSERVATIVE POLITICS DOMINATED BY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PART), (LDP) AND THE RECONFIGURATION OF JAPAN'S POLITICAL ECONOMY BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT UNDERLINES A NEW FLUIDITY IN BUREAUCRATIC POLICY-MAKING PROCESSES AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASING POLITICIZATION OF SOCIAL POLICY ISSUES AND THE ENTRY OF NEW PARTICIPANTS (SUCH AS WOMEN'S GROUPS) IN THE POLICY DEBATE. MOREOVER, IT HELPS US BRING INTO SHARPER FOCUS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GENDER AND WELFARE STATE RESTRUCTURING AND TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF BOW CHANGES IN GENDER RELATIONS ARE STIMULATING WELFARE STATE RESPONSES.",SOCIAL POLITICS,unambiguous,1
EXPERIENCING DEMOCRACY: WOMEN IN RURAL EAST GERMANY,VAN H B,2002,"THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE EXPERIENCES OF RURAL WOMEN IN EAST GERMAN), IN LIGHT OF THE TRANSFORMATION FRONT A SOCIALIST REGIME TO A MARKET-ORIENTED DEMOCRACY, DRAWING ON A STUDY CARRIED OUT IN MECKLENBURG-WEST POMERANIA BETWEEN 1996 AND 1999, THE ARTICLE DETAILS WOMEN'S POSITIVE RECOLLECTIONS OF LOCAL POLITICS IN THE FORMER GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (GDR) AND CONTRASTS THEM WITH THE PROBLEMS WOMEN FACE WITH THEIR INTEGRATION INTO POLITICAL STRUCTURES IN THE NEW GERMANY. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT TODAY'S LACK OF PARTICIPATION BY WOMEN CAN BE RELATED TO LEGACIES FROM THEIR SOCIALIST PAST AS WELL AS TO NARROW DEFINITIONS OF THE POLITICAL THAT OFFER FEW MECHANISMS AND INCENTIVES FOR INTEGRATING RURAL WOMEN INTO LOCAL POLITICS TODAY.",SOCIAL POLITICS,unambiguous,1
CHANGING THE SUBJECT: GENDER AND WELFARE REGIME STUDIES,BRUSH L,2002,"THIS ESSAY TAKES AS ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE A CENTRAL QUESTION OF SOCIAL POLITICS: WHAT AND BOTT, DOES GENDER CONTRIBUTE TO THE ANALYSIS OF STATES AND SOCIAL PROVISION? I ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHY FEMINIST CRITICS HAVE HAD SO LITTLE EFFECT ON MAINSTREAM WELFARE REGIME STUDIES. RESISTANCE TO FEMINIST CLAIMS PERSISTS DESPITE THE LARGELY UNTHREATENING NOTIONS OF GENDER AND WELFARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GENRE, OF WHICH I PROVIDE A CRITICAL EXPOSITION. I THEN USE ONE OF THE CATEGORIES PROPOSED BY JULIA ADAMS AND TASLEEM PADAMSEE'S RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF REGIME TO ELABORATE AN EXAMPLE OF THE LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES OF CURRENT PRACTICE IN GENDERED WELFARE REGIME STUDIES. I EXPLORE SOME OF THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE DOMINANCE OF THE WORKING MOTHER (AND BY EXTENSION THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN EARNING AND CARING) AS THE PRIVILEGED SUBJECT OF GENDERED WELFARE REGIME STUDIES. I CONCLUDE BY RECOMMENDING WE CHANGE THE SUBJECT OF SOCIAL POLITICS.",SOCIAL POLITICS,unambiguous,1
